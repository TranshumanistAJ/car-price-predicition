## ðŸ§¾ Project Overview

This Car Price Prediction App allows users to:

- Understand the structure and insights of the dataset.
- Explore correlations among variables.
- Perform hypothesis tests to see how features relate to the selling price.
- Input custom vehicle parameters and predict the car's price using a trained machine learning model.

The target variable is **`selling_price`**, and the model is trained on cleaned and preprocessed data derived from an original used car dataset.
